                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-6">A tranquil paradise of shimmering backwaters, mangroves, and canals, nestled by Vembanad Lake’s stunning expanse.</h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">A cluster of little islands on the picturesque Vembanad Lake, Kumarakom is a part of the Kuttanad region. With a labyrinth of backwaters and mangrove forests all around it, Kumarakom is a universe in itself. A laid-back, soothing world of its own. </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">The History of Kumarakom</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Located about 14 kms from Kottayam, Kumarakom village is spread over an area of 51.67 sq. km including the 24.13 sq. km of the lake. It was Mr. Alfred George Baker, his interest in agriculture and his love for nature that helped him create this treasure called Kumarakom from over 500 acres of wetlands that lay north-east of Lake Vembanad. </p>
                    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">It was in the 1840s that A. G. Baker approached the government with a request to grant him 500 acres of wetland in Kumarakom as he wanted to develop and use the land for paddy and coconut cultivation. Once he got the land he went on to fill the land with earth, levelling it up and then he planted coconut trees in over 150 acres. A part of the remaining land was developed for paddy cultivation in a way that irrigation would be easy. To make way for water passage through the land, canals were constructed and the mud taken out for constructing these canals was then reused to build bunds to prevent salt water from the surrounding areas from seeping in. The methods he used were eco friendly and therefore did no harm to the flora or fauna of the land. </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">An enchanting backwater destination, Kumarakom is one among the most visited tourist hotspots in the state for good reason. One of the most famous attractions of Kumarakom is the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary. Spread across 14 hectares of land, the sanctuary is home to numerous migratory birds and is an ornithologist's paradise. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The visionary that Baker was, after he planted the mangroves to prevent soil erosion, he left a large portion of the land untouched. Slowly nature took over and this became a haunt for local and migratory birds. The first scientifically formed and preserved bird sanctuary in India, over 180 different species of birds have been identified here. The credit for such biodiversity goes to the climatic peculiarities of the land, proximity to such a massive lake, the mangroves and the abundance of insects owing to the untouched nature of the land. </p>
                    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">Of the 25,000 birds that call this sanctuary home, over 90 species among them are migratory. Owl, cuckoo, egret, water fowl, woodpecker, moor hens, cormorants, darters and ducks are a common sight here. The migratory birds include Marsh Harriers, teals, larks, Siberian cranes, various species of herons, darters, bitterns, Brahminy kites and more. June to August is considered to be the ideal time to visit the sanctuary. </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Local Delicacies</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Another not-to-be missed highlight of Kumarakom is the Toddy shops in the vicinity and the lip smacking food they have on offer. Toddy refers to the indigenous beverage extracted from the inflorescence of the coconut tree. Collected in clay pots, the freshly collected toddy is sweet and called 'Madhura Kallu' in local parlance. Once the 'Madhura Kallu' is fermented it becomes sour. Kallappams, a famous Kerala dish made with rice flour often has sweet toddy as an added ingredient. </p>
                    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700">The biggest highlight of toddy shops and the area in general, is the culinary experience on offer. Savoury, spicy dishes that are imbued with the magical infusion of coconut milk make for an unforgettable experience. Duck and sea food are the specialities of the area and are not to be missed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Kumarakom is a land that exudes a unique sense of tranquility and peace. Here, time slows down. The backwaters are a parallel universe to the one on land. It is an experience that can be enjoyed and understood only in person.</p>
